# Padarom's Cubing Library
This is my personal library for all my cube-related concerns. It includes things such as my preferred algorithms in case I need to look them up again or common parity errors and working-outs for bigger cubes and shapeshifting cubes.

This page is public, but primarily meant for myself, so it might not be of much use to anyone else. It is also likely at all times a work-in-progress as I change algorithm preference or improve on the content.
